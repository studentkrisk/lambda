# lambda calculus!

the most functional programming language

### note that this version of lambda calculus uses different syntax than normal!

functions = `Î»x.{expression}`

applications = `({expression} {expression})`

variables = `{one character}`

to import standards, use `#import {name} {args}` (currently only church numerals (`churchnums`) are defined, with the only argument being the end of the range)

see [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus) for more information.
